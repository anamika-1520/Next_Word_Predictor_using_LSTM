# ðŸ§  Next Word Predictor using LSTM (Jupyter Notebook)

This is a simple and clean implementation of a **Next Word Prediction** model using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks, written entirely in a **single Jupyter Notebook**.

Given an input sequence like `"Machine learning is"`, the model will predict the most likely **next word**, such as `"powerful"`.
